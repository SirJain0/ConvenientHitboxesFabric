## General Info

Convenient Hitboxes is a utility mod that adds a button that toggles the hitboxes of entities and items, like F3 + B does. For the people that somehow canâ€™t use this keybind regularly (which can happen depending on the OS/keyboard), this mod is for you.

## More Details

This mod simply accompanies the F3 + B keybinding and does not replace or interfere with it. You can still use the keybinding with the mod just fine. If you are unsure  where the keybind is located, see the image above this description text, or see the images section of this mod.

Note: This mod works on both Forge and Fabric and has respective ports for each.
